# Biography

Brian Santich originates from Chico, a small town in northern California. He attended  UC Berkeley for his undergraduate degree, where his interest in immunology began while studying the role of B and T cells in dengue virus infections, under the mentorship of Dr. Simona Zompi in the laboratory of Dr. [Eva Harris](http://sph.berkeley.edu/eva-harris).

After graudation, Brian moved to Washington, DC, where he spent two years working as an [IRTA Fellow](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/postbac_irta) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under the mentorship of Dr. [Susan Moir](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/lab-sections/3218) in the laboratory of Dr. [Anthony Fauci](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/director). Here he continued his work in immunology, fousing on the role of antibody-producing B cells in immunodeficient patients, including those with genetic abnormailities such as [CGD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_granulomatous_disease) or suffering from chronic viral infections such as HIV. 

Subsequently, Brian moved to New York City to obtain his Ph.D at Memorial Sloan Kettering's graduate school, [Gerstner Sloan Kettering Graduate School of Biomedical Science](https://www.sloankettering.edu/gerstner), where he shifted the focus of his studies to the development of immunotherapies.

Currently Brian works as a full time graduate student in the field of immuno-oncology under the co-mentorship of Drs. [Nai-Kong Cheung](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/nai-kong-cheung) and [Morgan Huse](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/morgan-huse). His work focuses on developing next generation therapies for pediatric cancers, and understanding the mechanisms of antibody-based immunotherapies.
