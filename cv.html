			<p><em>Engineering of a highly potent scFv bispecific antibody (scBA) against GD2</em>
			<br>A  T-cell engaging scBa was developed using the hu3F8 variable region sequence. It was compared to a previously developed anti-GD2 scbA (5F11 scBA) both in vitro and in vivo. Despite an only 13-fold improvement in affinity we saw an over 1000-fold increase in in vitro potency (cytotoxicity) and very significant differences in in vivo potency (tumor shrinkage). This work suggests small increases in affinity can drive substantial increases in in vitro and in vivo efficacy, while keeping the epitope or antigen the same.

			<p><em>An Evaluation of B cells in patients with CGD</em>
			<br>B cells were isolated from patients with chronic granulomatous disease, a hereditary disease of the NADPH pathway, as well as healthy donors. B cells were analyzed functionally (elispot) and by surface markers (FACS). Previously it has been shown that despite having significantly lower absolute counts of CD27(+) B cells in the serum, patients with CGD still were able to produce comparable antibody responses to vaccination to healthy donors. In this evaluation, we showed that CGD patients contain a much larger proportion of CD27(-) memory B cells [IgG(+)] than healthy donors, and that these cells contain at least some of the anti-influenza B-cells that were generated by vaccination. This finding provides some explanation as to why CGD patients can mount relatively normal antibody-dependent vaccine responses, suggesting that non-classical memory B cells [CD27(-)IgG(+)] can contain a significant proportaion of anti-influenza
