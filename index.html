<p>
<b>Brian Santich - Math Tutor</b>
<br><b>Undergraduate:</b> UC Berkeley <em>BA Molecular and Cell Biology (Immunology), 2011</em>
<br><b>Graduate</b> Gerstner Sloan Kettering, MSKCC <em>Ph.D Immuno-oncology, 2018</em>
<br>I grew up in Chico, California and after completeing my undergraduate studies in UC Berkeley, moved to Washington, DC to work at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for two years, before starting my graduate work at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. I am currently a full time graudate student, in the process of earning my Ph.D. My work focuses on developing next generation therapies for pediatric cancers, such as neuroblastoma.
<br>I have tutored math students since 2007, when I graduated from high school. More professionally, I started in 2014, after finishing my course work in graduate school.
<br>While I mainly focus on prepratory work for standardized tests such as the SATs or GREs, I also offer tutoring in the subjects of algebra, geometry and trigonometry. My main strategy is to develop students' confidence in basic mathematics so that difficult-looking or indimidiating questions can be broken down into simpler problems that can be solved easily, confidiently and quicly.
